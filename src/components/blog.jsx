                    <p> My top playlists on Spotify include general genres like Pop, EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop, and Classical. 
                      I wanted to take a closer look at each collection I have made to see how I group songs. 
                      The first main way I group songs is by their genre and quality. "PLAY." was my first playlist and it comprises mostly 
                      pop songs and other radio hits dating back to the late 2000s. Towards the end of the playlist, 
                      it shifts into a long list of Coldplay songs from various albums as a personal order I like to listen to songs 
                      from my favorite band. "iDK" is basically "PLAY." style of songs that was not good enough to be in it. "EDM_" 
                      is my main EDM playlist, with "EDM2_" being the second one (creative, I know). This playlist features artists like Avicii, 
                      Calvin Harris, Kygo, ILLENIUM, Zedd, Gryffin, Porter Robinson, and many others. The playlist in itself is more house 
                      and popular EDM but some shades of trance and drum'n'bass do pop up too. "EDM2_", on the other hand, is more indie songs 
                      with fewer vocals and more emphasis on the actual sound. "Classical." is just classical music and "(instrumental)" is 
                      non-classical, vocal-less songs, many from movies or video games (also DJ Okawari). "NEW PLAY" consists of hip-hop like 
                      Kendrick, Cole, Gambino, and Em. The second way I organize music is by connecting it to a mood, time, or activity. 
                      Here are my remaining playlists and some context if needed: "sentiRead" (when reading slow/heavy text), "sunset~", 
                      "~moment" (for climax moments, mainly for reading),  "calm~", "Joy^", "üåßÔ∏è" (for when it's raining), "[READ]", "bedtime", 
                      "WAKE:", "apex" (when playing video games, mainly Apex Legends), "SPEED." (high-intensity music), "Seasonal" (for Christmas).

                    <h2 className="colorlib-heading"> My Recipe for Chicken Katsu </h2>
                    <p> This recipe is pretty basic but Chicken Katsu is my favorite dish and I wanted to document how I make it.
                       You will need chicken breast, egg, panko breadcrumbs, flour, salt, black pepper, togarashi, and frying oil 
                       (recommend peanut oil). Start by butterfly-ing the chicken so that we get cutlets by cutting the breast from 
                       the middle thickness until just before the edge. Then you should have a breast, half the thickness but twice 
                       the size, connected by one edge. Now you can tenderize the chicken and flatten it more until it reaches about 
                       half an inch in thickness. Next, we season (salt and pepper) the chicken and make the pan√© station. This comprises 
                       a bowl of seasoned flour (black pepper and togarashi), a bowl of eggwash (whisked/beaten egg), and a last bowl of 
                       panko breadcrumbs. The last setup will be to put the oil in a pan and turn it up to medium-high heat, test by throwing
                        a few bits of panko into the oil and it should take a minute or two to turn brown. It is more important to keep the 
                        oil at a consistent temperature than a fluctuating one and a "too low" temp is better than too high (will just take 
                        longer to fry). Finally, we can start cooking, start with drying off the chicken, then place it into the flour and 
                        coat it completly. Next, place in eggwash and coat completely. Last, coat in panko and press the breadcrumbs lightly 
                        into the cutlet to make sure they stick. Now gently drop into the oil and flip once the bottom is golden brown. Once 
                        the whole cutlet is a cohesive golden brown, take it out and let it rest on some paper towels to absorb the excess oil. 
                        Lastly, season with more togarashi and serve with rice and sliced cabbage.
