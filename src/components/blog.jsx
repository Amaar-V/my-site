                    <p>Hello, I am Amaar Valliani. I'm a senior at UC San Diego studying Mathematics-Computer Science. 
                        I have lived most of my life in Houston, TX and am currently live in San Diego, CA.
                        I enjoy working with Computer Science, especially when it comes to working on projects or teaching topics in the field.
                        I have worked as a tutor for the UCSD CSE department where I taught for 7 quarters with many courses (CSE 12, CSE 15L, CSE 100, CSE 105).
                        I plan to do a masters in Computer Science next year to continue my education and specialize further in the field.
